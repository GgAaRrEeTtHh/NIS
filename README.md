NIS Assignment 1

A server.java file implements a server that allows a client to connnect and send messages, the client.java implements the client
These two create and share files ,  PubkeyClient.txt and PubkeyServer.txt in the folder.
The implementation for this project (only concerned with security pgp ) will only work when both the server and client are run from the same folder

to run : 
compile the Client.java file - javac Client.java
compile the Server.java file - javac Server.java

Run the server first  - java Server
run the client (from a seperate command window ) - java Client

send messages to the server

Both the server and the client will print out the steps and data they take encrypting the decrypting the messages.
